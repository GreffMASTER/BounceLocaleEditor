# BounceLocaleEditor  
#### A tool that lets you read and modify Nokia's Bounce language files.  

This tool lets you edit localization files for the game Bounce made by Nokia in 2002.  
These files are in the Bounce jar file and start with `lang.` and the localization code. For example: `lang.en-US`. The default localization file is `lang.xx`. Use it as the template for new locales.  

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/GreffMASTER/BounceLocaleEditor/releases/latest) and run the JAR like a normal executable. You can also specify the path for the file as the first parameter to load the file on startup.
